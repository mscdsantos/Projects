#Description: Write a program asking to input the following information
#and print their payroll information

name = input("Enter employee's name: ")
#Ask user to input name
hoursworked = float(input("Enter number of hours worked in a week: "))
#ask user to input the number of hours worked in a week
hourlypay = float(input("Enter hourly pay rate: "))
#ask user to input hourly pay rate
federaltax = float(input("Enter federal tax withholding rate: "))
#ask user to input federal tax withholding % rate
statetax = float(input("Enter state tax withholding rate: "))
#ask user to input state tax withholding % rate
grosspay = hoursworked * hourlypay
#calculates gross pay by multiplying hours worked & hourlypay
federalwithholding = federaltax * grosspay
#calculates federal withholding dollar amount
statewithholding = statetax * grosspay
#calculates state withholding dollar amount
totaldeduction = federalwithholding + statewithholding
#calculates total deduction by combining dollar amount of state/tax withholding
statepercent = statetax*100
#converts state percent into number
federalpercent = federaltax*100
#converts federal percent into number
netpay = grosspay - totaldeduction
#calculates net pay by subtracting gross pay by total deduction
#the following commands print all the calculations made
print("\nEmployee Name:",name)
print("Hours Worked:",hoursworked)
print("Pay Rate: $",hourlypay)
print("Gross Pay: $",grosspay)
print("Deductions:")
print(" Federal withholding(",federalpercent,"%):$",federalwithholding)
print(" State Withholding(",statepercent,"%):$",statewithholding)
print(" Total Deduction: $",totaldeduction)
print("Net Pay: $",netpay)
