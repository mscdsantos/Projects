# Question 1: Writing a program that reads a celsius degree from the console and converts it to Fahrenheit
# and displays the result.
celsius = float(input("Enter a degree in Celsius: "))
#defining celsius
fahrenheit = (9 / 5)* celsius + 32
#formula for celsius conversion into fahrenheit
print(celsius, "Celsius", "is", fahrenheit, "Fahrenheit")


# Question 2: Write program that reads in an investment amount, annual interest
rate, and the number of
# years, displays the future investment value using the following formula
investmentAmount = float(input("Enter investment amount: "))
#entering float for investment amount
annualInterestRate = float(input("Enter annual interest rate: "))
#entering annual interest rate amount
monthlyInterestRate = annualInterestRate / 1200
#converting annual interest rate to monthly
numberOfYears = int(input("Enter number of years: "))
#entering number of years
numberOfMonths = (numberOfYears * 12)
#converting year to months
futureInvestmentValue = investmentAmount * (1 + monthlyInterestRate) **
numberOfMonths #this is the formula to compute investment value
print("Accumulated value is", futureInvestmentValue)


#Question 3: Write a program that reads an integer between 0 and 1000 and adds all
the digits in the int
x = int(input("Enter a number between 0 and 1000: "))
a = eval("x % 100")
#extracts 10ths & 1s digit
b = eval("x // 100")
#extracts 100th digit if there is one
c = eval("x % 10")
#extracts 1s digit
d = eval("a // 10")
#extracts 10ths digit from a
print("The sum of the digits is", b + c + d)
#Question 4: Write a program that prompts the user to enter weight in pounds and
height in inches
#displaying bmi
pound = float(input("Enter weight in pounds: "))
#asks user to input weight in lbs
inch = float(input("Enter height in inches: "))
#asks user to input height in inches
kilograms = (0.45359237 * pound)
#converts pounds to kilograms
meters = (0.0254 * inch)
#converts inches to meters
BMI = kilograms / (meters**2)
#calculates BMI
print("BMI is", BMI)
